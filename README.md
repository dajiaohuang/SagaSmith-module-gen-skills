## Not an "Idea Generator"

Most AI module tools produce a paragraph of prose — no structure, no numbers, no level design.

SagaSmith Module Generator produces **complete, import-ready module files**:

- ✅ Chapter-organized `# heading` structure (direct `dnd_module action=import`)
- ✅ Room-level `####` sub-headings with type tags (`room` / `statblock` / `list`)
- ✅ Full NPC dimensions: `name / race / class / alignment / want / fear / secret`
- ✅ Foreshadowing-recovery table + faction network + ending branches
- ✅ DC values + monster stat blocks + magic items
- ✅ Scene index JSON export (DM navigates without querying a database)
